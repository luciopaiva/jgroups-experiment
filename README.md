Experimenting with jGroups. Simple chat application based on the tutorial [here](http://www.jgroups.org/tutorial/).

To build:

    ./build.sh

To run a client instance:

    ./run.sh <user-name>

Where `<user-name>` is the nickname of the user entering the chat application.

Spawn as many clients as desired (even on the same machine) and play with it.
